# MaRS Laboratory SOP

The Malaria Resistance Surveillance or MaRS pipline, consists of a standardized laboratory and bioinformatics workflow for identifying variants in *Plasmodium falciparum* genomes conferring drug resistance. By streamlinging the data QC, alignment, and variant calling process, MaRS hopes to reduce time of analysis, as well allow for flexibilty of protocol used for the BGS analysis.
